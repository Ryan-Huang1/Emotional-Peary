## Contrubiting Drawings

[Templates](https://github.com/Ryan-Huang1/Emotional-Peary/tree/master/pears/templates) which your emotion drawing will be drawn on

All drawing ideas are welcome, all that I ask is that they are SFW. They should also follow the general style in the [existing emotions](https://github.com/Ryan-Huang1/Emotional-Peary/tree/master/pears). Something to keep in mind is that there are 2 pears your drawing will have to fit, however the drawings are not requiered to have the same proprotions for the 2 pears.
